servo motor control code and main code \
servo control code need two sg90 servo motors\
used turret method\
\
2023.08.21.\
I ran these codes and I recorrected some parts of them.\
also, it worked but motors didn't. If moters start to run, then the program died.\
terminal said, it has cleanup problem so I will research it\
\
2023.08.22.\
I uploaded colour tracker without P.R. and motors\
and also added circle, rectangle and lattice on the screen\
but didn't solve clean up issue yet\
I will add HSV spectrum bar so user can easily check the tracking colour\
We have to considering about HSL because L(lightness) will be more practical then V(value)\
